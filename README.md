TODO: make a gui // abstract puzzle dimensions // add a more thoughtful random number gen


# puzzle_generator
generate 3 by 2 puzzles in rust with any image using plotters and image crates

put the amount of puzzles pieces you want on line 193 (let pieces = {number of pieces you want}f64)

Basically just divides up the piece count into the middlemost factors, and subdivides the dimensions of the puzzle by the factors. Uses those subdivisions to make b spline curves based on start and endpoints with slight random variations.

this is the first rust thing I've ever done besides hello world so please be nice
